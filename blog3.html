            <h4>Author: P.D. Quaver</h4>
            <h4>Genre: Historical fiction, musical prodigies.</h4>
            <h4>Year Published: 2022</h4>

        <p>Writing a follow-up to a successful first novel, or one that has received a massively positive reception, is maintaining that standard of quality while not repeating yourself. This is something that separates decent authors from the best ones and P.D. Quaver does this extremely well here.

            The first Elly Robin novel was a very enjoyable experience, establishing the world-building that the author was going on while giving us an endearing and captivating protagonist. This second novel pushes the envelope and adds more layers of complexity while maintaining the elements that made the first one so great.
            
            This one is also shorter, but it flows naturally and is enjoyable, much like a sweet pastry. Itâ€™s the kind of book that you could probably finish in a weekend if the story captivates you. And that this story does.
            
            I would also like to point out that Quaver, at least from my perspective, got better with dialogue this time around. Probably due to research and haveing a clearer view of the story in mind, thus giving the dialogue a much more natural and realistic feel.
            
            Definitely one of those books that you need to keep in mind if you want a fun, enjoyable read.</p>
